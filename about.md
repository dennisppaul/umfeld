well, *Umgebung* is actually imitating [Processing.org](https://processing.org) quite bluntly ;)

this project aims to supply a framework that allows writing applications that more or less look like
original [Processing.org](https://processing.org) sketches. note the character of this project is that features will be
added as they are needed. it might partly replicate but not fully emulate the
original [Processing.org](https://processing.org) environment.

*Umgebung* may also function as a statement on what is good and valuable about
the [Processing.org](https://processing.org) *idiom* while at the same time suggesting disconnecting it from one
specific group, application or project â€¦ maybe a bit like markdown in that sense.

see [DOCUMENTATION](./DOCUMENTATION.md) for usage information    
and [examples](https://github.com/dennisppaul/umgebung-examples) for applications.

## Why *Umgebung*?

*Umgebung* is yet another programming environment for designers, makers, and artists. so why does it exist? and why not
use [Processing.org](https://processing.org), [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc), [Cinder](https://libcinder.org)
or any of the other frameworks out there?

well, the main reason why we even created *Umgebung* was basically to have a C++ derivative of Processing.org that stays
very close to the *original* idiom. while Cinder and OpenFrameworks, for example, are fantastic projects, they differ
quite a lot from the *Processing.org Idiom* ( i.e a `setup()-draw()` structure, `stroke()+fill()` and shape-based
drawing, etcetera ). *Umgebung*, however, literally imitates core Processing classes and functions.

why not use the original Java-based *Processing.org* then? there are a few key aspects that just cannot and probably
will never be resolved due to limitations imposed by Java. while Java is a very well-designed language and does many
things better than C/C++, it has some drawbacks.

the most important benefit of moving to C/C++ is the availability of many extremely powerful and widespread libraries
and APIs ( e.g OpenGL, OpenCV, FFmpeg, PortAudio ) that can be natively used and integrated into applications and
sketches without the need for a native binding library. while many of these libraries have been fully or partly made
accessible in Processing through native bindings, oftentimes these libraries or their bindings introduce significant
overhead ( technically, administratively, etcetera ), are not at the current version, are incompatible with newer
versions of OSes, or do not expose all functionality ( e.g unstable webcam support on macOS ). while this also happens
with C/C++ libraries and APIs, the problems are greatly reduced. also, there is still a significant number of libraries
and APIs not available for Java-based Processing or that are impossible to port because of limitations posed by Java VM
implementations ( e.g multi-channel audio ).

in addition to this, due to the nature of C/C++ and the way *Umgebung* is implemented, applications and sketches
developed with *Umgebung* can be built and deployed with a very(!) small memory and CPU footprint. this means that
applications and sketches can potentially run on smaller or older hardware like, e.g Raspberry Pi. some modules can even
be excluded from a build to reduce the footprint even more. *Umgebung* can even run *truly* headless ( i.e it does not
require any virtual offscreen graphics driver if no window is required ).

furthermore, *Umgebung* uses CMake as a build system. CMake is very well-designed and more or less easy to learn and
extend. this also means that *Umgebung* applications and sketches can be developed in more or less any text editor or
IDE ( e.g Visual Studio Code, Zed, CLion, Vim ). it does not require proprietary build systems like Xcode.

and finally, although C and especially C++ is known for its horrific errors, confusing error messages, and volatile
behavior at times, with the advent of LLM-based programming assistants, the entry threshold can be greatly reduced.
trust the process.
