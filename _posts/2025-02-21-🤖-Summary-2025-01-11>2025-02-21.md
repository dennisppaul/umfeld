The SDL3-dev branch marks the beginning of a major transition and overhaul in Umgebung, shifting from SDL2 to SDL3 while also introducing significant structural improvements. The transition primarily involved updating CMake configurations to properly integrate SDL3, replacing outdated pkg_search_module(SDL2) calls with find_package(SDL3), and ensuring compatibility across different platforms. A new modular structure was introduced, refactoring major components such as UmgebungDefines.h, UmgebungFunctions.h, and UmgebungConstants.h to improve maintainability. Several new header files, including UmgebungPGraphicsInterface.h and UmgebungSubsystemGraphicsDefault.h, were added to streamline graphics handling. Additionally, early discussions on migrating from OpenGL to SDL_gpu were documented, considering future-proofing against Appleâ€™s potential OpenGL deprecation. This foundational work sets the stage for further SDL3 integration and modernization of the rendering pipeline.
