Over the last month we’ve polished up project infrastructure and shipped v2.3.0: we fixed a missing vertex in our point‐shape implementation and added a getter for stroke render mode, tightened up our CMake scripts with a major rework of package‐finding (merging the dev-discover-packages branch) and cleaner option handling, improved logging symbols and pedantic compiler warnings, and corrected platform-specific quirks like Raspberry Pi’s OpenGL ES path and Windows’ pdcurses integration; on the tooling side we enhanced our bug report templates with clearer defaults and helpful “where to find” instructions, streamlined installation scripts, made SDL our default audio engine while adding true threaded audio support and console_once() helpers, updated terminal renderer behavior, revised documentation links and added a dedicated Known-Differences page, refreshed the project logotype, and bundled all these updates under the new 2.3.0 release tag—ensuring more robust builds, smoother installs, and richer functionality across platforms.
