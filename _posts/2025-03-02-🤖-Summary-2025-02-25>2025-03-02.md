Over the past week, the Umgebung project has seen a major push toward improving immediate mode rendering, refining matrix handling, and expanding primitive shape support. The biggest update is the introduction of a more efficient immediate mode, allowing for on-the-fly rendering of lines, triangles, and other shapes without preallocating buffers. Alongside this, a new triangulation function for concave polygons was implemented, though it remains a work in progress. The rendering pipeline has been further optimized with smoothed line rendering, improved matrix transformation consistency, and enhanced buffer resizing strategies to minimize reallocations. Additionally, beginShape() and endShape() were refined to support more flexible rendering strategies, improving how complex shapes like polygons and quads are drawn. These updates bring Umgebung closer to a robust, modernized OpenGL framework while preserving its Processing-inspired usability.
