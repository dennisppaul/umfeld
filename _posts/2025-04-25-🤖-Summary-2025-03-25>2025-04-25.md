Between March 25 and April 25, the Umfeld project focused on refinements, documentation, and user-facing stability improvements. A major usability update involved adjusting the behavior of loadImage() and loadFont() to provide clearer error messages and rely on sketchPath() to resolve relative paths, reducing confusion about asset loading. A significant amount of effort was dedicated to clarifying function behavior, replacing ambiguous utility names like exists() with file_exists() and directory_exists() for readability. File handling across PImage, PFont, loadOBJ, and loadSample was unified and now consistently checks for file presence before attempting to load. On the audio side, the Sampler loader was made more robust, and progress continued on audio and event subsystem integration. Windows build instructions were updated to include full SDL3 support, and a new ‚ÄúUmfeld in Visual Studio Code‚Äù guide was added to the documentation to ease development setup. Lastly, a dedicated function overview was compiled to document all additions made to the Processing-like interface, helping to differentiate Umfeld from its inspiration while making its extensions more transparent.
