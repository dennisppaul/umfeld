Over the past few weeks, weâ€™ve given Umfeld a major polish under the hood and in the documentation: the installation experience is now rock-solid across platforms, with refined, unified scripts that auto-detect Windows, Linux (including Raspberry Pi) and macOS, support custom install paths, and cleanly copy over data folders after builds; our build scripts have been tightened up, CLion integration docs expanded to cover updating from GitHub and proper UCRT64/CMake toolchain setup, and the FFT implementation on Windows has been corrected for aligned memory allocation; at the API level, weâ€™ve added the convenience functions noLoop() and redraw() to give sketches finer control over frame updates, while behind the scenes we merged branches, fixed minor bugs (like loadWAV path handling), tidied up commit history, and incremented to v2.1.0â€”making Umfeld easier and more reliable to install, build, and experiment with than ever before.
