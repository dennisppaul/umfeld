In this recent development sprint, the _Umfeld_ project took a major leap forward by fully reviving the **OpenGL 2.0 rendering backend**, bringing it up to par with its 3.3 counterpart. This involved reintroducing and modernizing core functionality, including framebuffer management, shape rendering, and texture handling. A consistent **rendering interface** was established across versions, ensuring that `PGraphicsOpenGLv20` and `PGraphicsOpenGLv33` now share unified method definitions, while allowing backend-specific implementations. The codebase also underwent extensive refactoring: constants related to OpenGL were centralized in a new `PGraphicsOpenGLConstants` header, and shape constants were reorganized using enums to improve clarity and maintainability. Immediate-mode rendering in OpenGL 2.0 was streamlined with support for fill and stroke operations, and the rendering mode system (`RENDER_MODE_IMMEDIATE`, `RENDER_MODE_SHAPE`, etc.) was standardized across contexts. These foundational changes position the project for easier extension, clearer graphics abstraction, and better cross-version support going forward.
