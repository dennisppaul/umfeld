*Umgebung* is in a phase of intense transition which basically means the following:

- making infrastructure more flexible so that it becomes easier to integrate other renderers
- move away from OpenGL 2.0 ( fixed-function pipeline )
- support OpenGL 3.3 core
- support OpenGL ES 3.1 ( RPI + iOS )
- lay foundation to support `SDL_gpu` ( one day ;) ) ( for Vulkan, Metal + Direct3D support )
