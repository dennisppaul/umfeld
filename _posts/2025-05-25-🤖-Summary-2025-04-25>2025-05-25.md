Between April 25 and May 25, the Umfeld project focused on solidifying its infrastructure and improving usability across platforms. A major change was the migration of Raspberry Pi image creation tools to a separate repository, signaling a cleanup and modularization of system-level utilities. Additionally, the project underwent a license overhaul, replacing the MIT license with the GNU General Public License v3, reflecting a stronger emphasis on software freedom and openness. Several scripts for creating and sanitizing Raspberry Pi images were refined or removed, and detailed installation instructions for Raspberry Pi were added to the documentation. On the usability front, the project introduced screen_size_x and screen_size_y variables for querying screen resolution and improved support for KMSDRM (Direct Rendering), enabling Umfeld applications to run without a desktop environment on Raspberry Pi. A key build improvement included activating ANGLE support by default for OpenGL ES emulation on macOS. Documentation also expanded, including a function index differentiating Umfeld from Processing, clearer VS Code/CLion setup guides, and improvements to cross-platform compatibility.
