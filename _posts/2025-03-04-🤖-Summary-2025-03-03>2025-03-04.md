Over the past two days, significant progress has been made in the Umgebung project, particularly in enhancing font rendering and refining the graphics pipeline. A major effort has gone into implementing SDL-based TTF font rendering, including the creation of a font atlas for efficient text rendering. This update introduces glyph handling with kerning adjustments, texture-based font rendering, and integration with PGraphics for streamlined text drawing. Additionally, a model matrix dirty flag was introduced to optimize transformations, along with a lookup table (LUT) for ellipses to improve rendering accuracy. Various cleanup operations were performed, including restructuring CMake dependencies, removing unused OpenGL references in PImage, and refining PGraphicsOpenGLv33 functions. These changes mark an important step in modernizing the library while maintaining its Processing-like usability.
