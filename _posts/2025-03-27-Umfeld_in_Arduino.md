Wait a minute! Is this sketch run from the *Arduino IDE*? how cool is that?!?

Check out the ( still very experimental, only tested in macOS on Apple Silicon ) repository: [Umfeld-Arduino](https://github.com/dennisppaul/umfeld-arduino)

PS i just found out that it is possible to run files with the extension `.pde` ( probably for historical reasons ), however, it seem more appropiate append `.ino` to a sketch â€¦ as in *normal* arduino applications.
