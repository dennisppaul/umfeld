Over the past few days, the Umgebung project has undergone a significant refactor, particularly in its rendering architecture. The most notable change is the renaming of Renderer to PGraphicsOpenGLv33, aligning the naming convention with Processingâ€™s PGraphics model and making it clearer that this is an OpenGL 3.3-based implementation. Alongside this, multiple improvements were introduced, including optimized texture loading, better vertex handling, and a cleaner shader structure. The rendering pipeline now supports stroke and fill operations separately, with dedicated buffer handling for each, improving efficiency and flexibility. Additionally, a new linse() method was introduced as an alias for line(), and various cleanup tasks were performed, including improved function naming and removing redundant code. These updates mark a step toward a more structured, Processing-like API while maintaining OpenGL 3.3 performance optimizations.
