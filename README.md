*Umgebung* is a light-weight C++ environment for small audio and graphics based applications. it is somewhat inspired by [Processing.org](https://processing.org) and the like.

## Prerequisite ( for MacOS )

in order to compile and run application install the following packages with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install glfw
$ brew install portaudio
$ brew install ftgl
```

## Build Applications with *Umgebung*

an example application can be found in the `example` folder. to run the example application do the following:

```
$ cd example
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./umgebung-example-app
```

if changes are made to `umgebung-example-app.cppâ€Œ` ( or any other file in that folder ) it is enough to just run:

```
$ make ; ./umgebung-example-app
```

## Known Issues

- only tested on MacOS. although theoretically the external libraries as well as the build system should be cross-platform ( i.e Macos, Linux, Windows )
- portaudio is manually configured because it does not work on all machines. this *dirty hack* is somewhat buggy and sometimes requires to call `cmake ..` again after `make` fails once
