*Umgebung* is a light-weight C++ environment for small audio and graphics based applications. it is somewhat inspired by [Processing.org](https://processing.org) and the like.

## prerequisite ( for MacOS )

in order to compile and run application install the following packages with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install glfw
$ brew install portaudio
```

## Build Applications with *Umgebung*

an example application can be found in the `example` folder. to run the example application do the following:

```
$ cd example
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./umgebung-example-app
```

if changes are made to `umgebung-example-app.cppâ€Œ` ( or any other file in that folder ) it is enough to just run:

```
$ make ; ./umgebung-example-app
```
